@section main-intro Introduction
Welcome to the website of the OpenEA project. The OpenEA project is an open-source framework
for Evolutionary Computing built in C++. The framework is general-purpose and can be expanded
to fit any demand without sacrificing speed and reusability. Here are the main features of the framework:

- General interface for representations and fitness: Genome, Fitness, Pool
- General interface for operators: Variator, Selector, Evaluator
- General interface for algorithms: Strategy, Operator
- Two programming options: C++ code or EAML configuration file
- Powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI) allowing fast configuration
- Plugin loader which loads user code without recompiling
- Parallelism via MultiThreading or Distributed Computatation on Cluster
- Back-up to and %Restore from file system
- Speed tracker (both generational and for each phase)

The OpenEA framework is distributed using
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GNU General Public License version 3</a>.
The framework is written and maintained by <a href="mailto:minhcly95@outlook.com">BÃ¹i Quang Minh</a>.

@note
The framework is in the Alpha state, therefore please expect changes in API.

@section main-install Installation
Currently, the framework is only tested on Ubuntu 16.04 system.
There are two ways to install the framework: from Ubuntu Launchpad (@cmd{apt-get}) and directly from GitHub.

@subsection main-apt Ubuntu Launchpad
To install the framework using @cmd{apt-get}, first, add the following PPA to your system:

@code
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:minhcly95/openea
sudo apt-get update
@endcode

Then, install the package @tt{libopenea-cli} which includes both the library and the CLI tool:

@code
sudo apt-get install libopenea-cli
@endcode

To test the installation, enter the command:

@code
openea
@endcode

And a list of available sub-commands should be printed on the terminal. 

@subsection main-github GitHub
To install from GitHub, first, clone the repository to your computer:

@code
git clone https://github.com/minhcly95/openea.git
@endcode

Then, run the Makefile using the command:

@code
sudo make install
@endcode

This command will compile the source and create symbolic <b>links</b> to the binary and source files,
so you can include and link them any where on your machine.
To test the installation, enter the command:

@code
openea
@endcode

And a list of available sub-commands should be printed on the terminal. 

@section main-howtouse How to use
For new users, it is recommended to read the @ref tutorials page to get used to the framework.
More tutorials are being written, so don't be disappointed.
All available operators are described in the @ref operators page. For more information, check the
API documentation of each class.

@note
Users of the library should understand the basic operation of Evolutionary Computing and C++ programming.
If you don't know what is an Evolutionary Algoithm, I recommend the book 
* **Introduction to Evolutionary Computing**, 2nd Edition, 2015 by *A.E. Eiben* and *J.E. Smith*.
