/**
 * @class Strategy
 * The interface for execution order (algorithm).
 *
 * This class provides the interface to implement custom call order or algorithm.
 * To start an EA, users need to create an instance of Strategy implementation
 * and call the Evolve() function.
 * If users want to use an implemented trivial Strategy, please take a look at DefaultStrategy.
 *
 * To define a custom strategy, first, operators must be defined by using the wrapper as
 * Operator, OperatorGroup and SeriesOperatorGroup.
 * Then, users need to override four functions:
 * - Setup(): Run when no Population is provided when Evolve() is called.
 * - Begin(): Run before the evolution starts.
 * - Loop(): Run each generation.
 * - End(): Run after the evolution ends.
 *
 * In those functions, users manipulate the Pool get by GetPool(), using the
 * defined Operator and OperatorGroup via Execute function. Finally, set the Pool back to
 * the Population by using SetPool().
 *
 * Every Strategy already has an OperatorGroup of Hook named @ref hooks. Users can re-use this group
 * or define for themselves a new group of Hook.
 *
 * Strategy interface is Constructible, and is the root element of an EAML file.
 * This means users can define their own EAML template corresponding to their custom-defined
 * Strategy, including the names of the operators and their types.
 *
 * @see DefaultStrategy
 *
 * @see Operator
 * @see OperatorGroup
 * @see SeriesOperatorGroup

/**
 * @var OperatorGroup<Hook> Strategy::hooks
 * The global OperatorGroup of Hook.
 * Functions of the Hook added to this group will be called after the corresponding Strategy methods are called:
 * - Hook::Initial(): after Setup()
 * - Hook::Start(): after Begin()
 * - Hook::Generational(): after Loop()
 * - Hook::End(): after End()
 */

/**
 * @fn bool Strategy::IsReady()
 * Check the readiness of the Strategy.
 * If users want to perform some checks before strating the evolution process, they can override this function
 * and return a predicate whether the Strategy is ready or not. The default implementation is always true.
 * @return Whether the Strategy is ready. Default implementation is always true.
 */

/**
 * @fn void Strategy::Setup()
 * Procedure to initialize a new Population.
 * This function needs to be overridden in child classes. This function will be invoked when Evolve() is called
 * with no Population object. In that case, a new Population will be created and this function will initialize
 * that Population.
 */

/**
 * @fn void Strategy::Begin()
 * Procedure executed before the evolution starts.
 * This function doesn't need to be overridden in child classes. This function will be called once when users call Evolve(),
 * before the loop starts, no matter if a Population is given or not.
 * If no Population is given, Begin() will be executed after Setup().
 */

/**
 * @fn void Strategy::Loop()
 * Procedure executed each generation.
 * This function needs to be overridden in child classes. This function is the main procedure of the Strategy and
 * will be invoked each generation. Users should implement the regular evolutionary process here.
 */

/**
 * @fn void Strategy::End()
 * Procedure executed after the evolution ends.
 * This function doesn't need to be overridden in child classes. This function is the counterpart of Begin() and
 * will be called once before Evolve() is returned.
